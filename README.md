# TuringMachineSim
## Technologies Used
- Java

## About This Project
This was a programming assignment for a Computation Theory course in which I had to create a Java program that would simulate a Turing Machine, taking different text files
and requesting the user type in a string input to decide whether the string is accepted by the Turing Machine or not.
